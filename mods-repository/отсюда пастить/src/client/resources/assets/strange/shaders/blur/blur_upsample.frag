    // Ah, I read blur_downsample.frag twice or the tool output was confusing?
    // And the content was IDENTICAL to downsample.
    // That seems suspicious. Kawase upsample usually has fewer taps or slightly different kernel.

    // If the legacy code used the same kernel for both, it might be just a Gaussian-approximation.
    // Let's stick to what was in the legacy files, assuming it worked "perfectly" for the user.
    // BUT, I should check `blur_upsample.frag` content again to be 100% sure.
